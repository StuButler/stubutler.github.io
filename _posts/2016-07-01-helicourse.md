# Project Summary

This was the second Udemy course I created for ThunderSteed. The course focusses on creating a control system for helicopter utilising the "flying" movement in the character movement component.

The course starts with importing models and setting up materials before mocing on to creating the basic assets including the animation blueprint, character blueprint and game mode.

The 2 hours of video tutorials then cover helicopter movement, animations, audio and gameplay cameras as well as handling take off and landing.

### **Important Note**

It is important to note however that the course is designed for **Unreal Engine version 4.7.7** so many of the techniques and approaches may not be directly applicable to newer versions of the engine and there are many different solutions available now to create similar systems which don't leverage the Character Movement Component.
