# Project Summary

This was the first project I worked on in Unreal Engine 4. The introduction of Blueprint held a huge appeal for me having spent a few years working with, and teaching, UScript in UDK. 

The project, developed with the amazingly talented Unreal Engine expert, [Greg Penninck](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/greg-penninck-4736811a), took a different approach to the classic Infinite runner, opting for a side scroller system where the character needs to fall through levels in order to keep the character alive, collecting gold on the way down.

<!--### Character Setup

The character runs automatically, the player controls the direction by clicking in order to swap the direction.

### Level and Camera Setup

# Initial Workshop

The project was reverse engineered to deliver as a 2 day open access workshop at Staffordshire University to offer a learning opportunity for UE4 within a few weeks of the engine's release.

# Other Contributions

For this project I also modelled Walky, the bipedal robot who features in the game. The robot would later be used for animation tutorials and a host of other projects but this was his first outing for which he featured a small collection of coal in a recessed area on top of his body.

<!--*Include character presentation sheet?* -->

# Udemy Course

Following the succcess of the workshop, we were granted permission to launch the course as an Online Video Course on the Udemy Platform. 

The course includes more than 5 hours of video content created by Greg and I.

### **Important Note**

It is important to note however that the course is designed for **Unreal Engine version 4.0** so many of the techniques and approaches may not be directly applicable to newer versions of the engine.
