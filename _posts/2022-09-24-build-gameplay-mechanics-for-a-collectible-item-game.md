# Project Summary

This was my second course produced for Epic Games using the [Stack O Bot Project](https://marketplace-website-node-launcher-prod.ol.epicgames.com/ue/marketplace/en-US/product/stack-o-bot), and Unreal Game Sample created by the amazingly talented [Andreas Suika](https://twitter.com/andidev_).

This time, the course focusses on building new mechanics on top of the Stack-o-Bot functionality to explore the different approaches to communicating between blueprints in Unreal Engine 5.

The course begins by creating a new game mode and player controller for the collectible item game before creating all of the pickup and delivery mechanics.

Once the mechanics have been created, we move on to setting up a HUD to show how many orbs the character is carrying and how many have been delivered.

The game loop is then finalised by bulding in win conditions as well as Start and end Events created with Event Dispatchers.

# Topics Covered
