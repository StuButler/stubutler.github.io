### Project Summary

This was a project to create a racing livery for the Ginetta G40 in Project Cars 2 with Staffordshire University as the primary sponsor. The intention was for the livery to be used as part of a web-video series where influenctial members of the University community would race a lap in VR around the National layout at Silverstone which would form part of an interview segment similar to the star in a reasonably priced car interviews in Jeremy Clarkson's Top Gear.

Here's the finished texture in action around Oulton Park with me in the Motion Sim VR setup at the University:

### Influences and Logos

The livery needed to use only brands assosciated with Staffordshire University or those already appearing in game.

Here's an influence sheet I put together to start to build some ideas:

### Livery Design Image

When designing liveries, I like to do mockups on a photo of the car (or motorbike) first to really get a feel for the look I'm trying to achieve before moving onto the in game textures.

This is the design I came up with and showed to the team for approval before moving on:

The name board on the roof is for Chris Headleand, Head of the Games Development Department.

### Final Texture

The final texture was produced entirely in Photoshop
