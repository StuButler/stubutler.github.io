### Project Summary

This was a project to create a racing livery for the Ginetta G40 in Project Cars 2 with Staffordshire University as the primary sponsor. The intention was for the livery to be used as part of a web-video series where influenctial members of the University community would race a lap in VR around the National layout at Silverstone which would form part of an interview segment similar to the star in a reasonably priced car interviews in Jeremy Clarkson's Top Gear.

Here's the finished texture in action around Oulton Park with me in the Motion Sim VR setup at the University:

### Influences and Logos

The livery needed to use only brands assosciated with Staffordshire University or those already appearing in game.

Here's a sheet I put together of the various logos I had available including some internal project logos such as the the Forge (Forum for Games Education) logo created by [Shaun Reeves](https://twitter.com/shaunreeves).

The logos mixed with a whole bunch of example Ginettas gave me some great ideas of how I wanted the car to look.

### Livery Design Image

When designing liveries, I like to do mockups on a photo of the car (or motorbike) first to really get a feel for the look I'm trying to achieve before moving onto the in game textures.

This is the design I came up with and showed to the team for approval before moving on.

The name board on the roof is for [Chris Headleand](https://chrisheadleand.com/), the Head of the Games Development Department at Staffs Uni who was the architect behind the project, adapting a concept he'd used at his previous institution.

### Final Texture

The final texture was produced entirely in Photoshop making use of the Project Cars 2 Templates (the official resource for these are sadly no longer available) as a guide for producing the skin which is below, with my name and the Welsh flag on the roof. The Beacon Bot eyes were a fun addition when trying to work out what to do with the stripe on the window.
