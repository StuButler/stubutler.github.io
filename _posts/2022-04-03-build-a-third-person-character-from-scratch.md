# Project Summary

This was my first course produced for Epic Games using the [Stack O Bot Project](https://marketplace-website-node-launcher-prod.ol.epicgames.com/ue/marketplace/en-US/product/stack-o-bot) and Unreal Game Sample created by the amazingly talented [Andreas Suika](https://twitter.com/andidev_).

This course was part of the launch learning materials when Unreal Engine 5 launched in April.

The course guides viewers throught the processs of re-creating a _slightly simplfied_ version of the Stack-o-Bot character whilst retaining all of the key features of the character.

Beginning by creating the required assets for the character and seting up defaults, we move on to add a camera so the character can be placed in the world and then setting up controls using the Enhanced Input System.

We then explore a selection of cameras before moving on to explore the animation systems including blendspaces and animation blueprints to create movement animation systems including leaning.

The course concludes by exploring vertical movement with alternative jumps and landings depending on if the character is standing still or moving and the fascinating jetpack system which includes creating a metasounds system to add audio to the jetpack.
