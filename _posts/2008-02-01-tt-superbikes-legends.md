# Project Summary

This was the second game I worked on during my time at Jester Interactive.

Originally a mode within the [TT Superbikes: Real Road Racing Championship](/blog/tt-superbikes-rrrc), I was responsible for designing how the mode would work, incorporating a plethora of amazing classic racing bikes into the game, proposing the idea of competing in historic race events to either recreate or rewrite history.

Shortly before release, the mode was removed from RRRC and became a game in its own right to be released a short time later, allowing players to race as one of many legendary riders.

The mode was expanded for the game to feature an array of one make races to earn to the opportunity to race the historic events. This required us to create a series of plain liveries for each of the iconic machines.

I was responsible for creating 13 of the in-game bike models (and all variants of their textures) which can be seen on my [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/x6Q4W) page for the project.

# Gameplay Video

I couldn't find any of the original footage we created but I did find a video of someone switching through the various bikes on YouTube from 2014, the video quality isn't great but it's great to see the game again.
