# Project Summary

This was the first game I worked on during my time at Jester Interactive.

Originally hired as a placement student due to my experience producing bike textures as part of the GP500 mod community, I was initially tasked with completing research into bike characteristics, such as top speed an acceleration times but was quickly given the opportunity to produce bikes for the game including many iconic race bikes from 2006 to 2008.

As part of my expanding role within the team, I took on the task of leading on vehicle art in both a producer/art manager-esque role, organising a vareity of outsource artists and providing critique and feedback in a lead artist role to ensure a consistant level of quality across all of the bikes in the game.

In the end I contributed a large number of bikes and a significant percentage of the variant textures in game.

I was also responsible for modifying, re-unwrapping and re-skinning the rider model to allow us to texture the arms and legs independantly, improving on the mirrored legs and arm textures in the original TT Superbikes game and I also reworked the environment map to provide a better visual result, allowing the bikes to appear shinier and more impressive. As well as this, I created a new set of graphics for the rev counter to help update the HUD.

# Gameplay Video

The official [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TTSuperbikesRRRC) still exists with a selection of pre-release gameplay videos showing off the tracks included in the game as well as a whole bunch of my artwork.

I recently found this awesome video which has a segment show casing the array of bikes in game, many of which I created.
